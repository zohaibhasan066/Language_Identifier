## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a language classification model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model is trained to identify the language of a given text input.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of [briefly describe the dataset, e.g., language samples, text data]. The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Model Architecture

The notebook utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, specifically [mention if it's LSTM, GRU, or Vanilla RNN]. Key features of the model include:
- Input layer: [describe input layer]
- Hidden layers: [describe hidden layers and their types]
- Output layer: [describe output layer]

## Training

The model is trained using [mention the optimizer, loss function, and any specific training strategies used]. The training process is visualized using loss and accuracy metrics over epochs.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using [mention metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.]. The notebook includes visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves to analyze the results.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the library used)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RNN_Languageclassification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RNN_Languageclassification
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RNN_Languageclassification.ipynb
   ```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 96.4% on the test set. Additional results and visualizations can be found in the notebook.
