## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a language classification model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model is trained to identify the language of a given text input.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of [briefly describe the dataset, e.g., language samples, text data]. The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

## Model Architecture

Model Architecture
The notebook utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). This model is designed to handle sequential data effectively, making it well-suited for language classification tasks. Key features of the model include:

-Input layer: The input layer is an embedding layer that converts each word in the input text into a dense vector of fixed size. This layer helps in capturing semantic meanings and relationships between words in a lower-dimensional space.

-Hidden layers:
  -LSTM layer: The core of the model is an LSTM layer, which processes the input sequences to capture temporal dependencies and context. This layer is capable of learning long-range dependencies in sequences, which is crucial for understanding language.

  -Dropout layer: A dropout layer is applied to the output of the LSTM layer to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of the units during training. This encourages the model to generalize better to unseen data.

  -Dense layer: A fully connected dense layer follows the LSTM layer to interpret the output of the LSTM into a format suitable for classification. This layer is often used to transform the LSTM outputs into logits for the final classification.

-Output layer: The output layer is a softmax layer that produces a probability distribution over the possible languages. This layer uses the output from the dense layer to determine the most likely language for the given input text.

By incorporating an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, dropout, and a dense layer, this model effectively learns and generalizes patterns in language data for accurate classification.

## Training

The model is trained using [mention the optimizer, loss function, and any specific training strategies used]. The training process is visualized using loss and accuracy metrics over epochs.
